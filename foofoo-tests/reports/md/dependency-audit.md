# FooFoo Dependency Audit
**Date:** 2026-05-25 (re-verified + `npm audit fix` applied 2026-06-17)  
**Auditor:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-6)  
**Projects:** foofoo/ (Expo SDK 56.0.4, RN 0.85.3) · foofoo-tests/

> **2026-06-17 update:** Re-ran `npm audit` in both projects before applying any fix. `foofoo/` had drifted to 1 low / 14 moderate / 2 high / 1 critical (18 total) — extra findings beyond the 13-moderate uuid baseline were `shell-quote` (critical, GHSA-w7jw-789q-3m8p), `tmp` (high, GHSA-ph9p-34f9-6g65), `ws` (high, GHSA-96hv-2xvq-fx4p), `js-yaml` (moderate, GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68), `@babel/core` (low, GHSA-4x5r-pxfx-6jf8) — all transitive devDependency/build-tooling packages with **non-breaking** fixes available. Ran plain `npm audit fix` (no `--force`) in `foofoo/`: resolved the critical, both highs, the extra moderate, and the low, landing back exactly on the **13 moderate / 0 high / 0 critical uuid baseline**. `foofoo-tests/` had drifted to 1 low / 22 moderate / 1 high (24 total, vs the previous "0 vulnerabilities" baseline — newer `jest`/`detox`/`ts-jest` transitive chain). `npm audit fix` (no `--force`) resolved the high (`tmp`) and the low (`@babel/core`); the 22 moderate findings (`jest`, `@jest/*`, `detox`, `ts-jest`, `js-yaml` via ts-jest, `babel-jest`, etc.) all require a `isSemVerMajor: true` bump (e.g. `jest` 25→30, `detox` 19→24, `ts-jest` 29→latest) and were **not** applied per the no-major-bump guardrail — documented as deferred below. Verified after fix: `foofoo/` and `foofoo-tests/` both `tsc --noEmit` clean (0 errors); `foofoo-tests/` unit suite 417/417 passing (suite has grown since the 104/104 figure recorded elsewhere in this doc — that figure is from the 2026-05-25 run and is now stale).

## Task 1 — Security Vulnerabilities

### foofoo/ (Main App)

**Total:** 13 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical  
Raw JSON: `reports/md/npm-audit-app.json`

#### Root cause

All 13 moderate vulnerabilities trace back to a single actual CVE:

| CVE | Package | Affected range | Description |
|-----|---------|----------------|-------------|
| GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq | `uuid` | `< 11.1.1` | Missing buffer bounds check in v3/v5/v6 when `buf` argument is provided |

The `uuid` package is a transitive dependency of `@expo/ngrok` (devDep) and `xcode` (which is a dep of `@expo/config-plugins`, which is a dep of `expo` itself). The cascade spreads to: `@expo/cli`, `@expo/config`, `@expo/config-plugins`, `@expo/inline-modules`, `@expo/local-build-cache-provider`, `@expo/metro-config`, `@expo/prebuild-config`, `expo`, `@sentry/react-native`, and `onesignal-expo-plugin`.

#### Severity classification

**CRITICAL / HIGH:** None found.

**MODERATE (13 — all deferred, see below):**

| Package | Affected versions | Via | FooFoo feature |
|---------|------------------|-----|----------------|
| `uuid` (root) | `< 11.1.1` | Direct CVE | Transitive dep of `@expo/ngrok` (devDep tunnel) |
| `xcode` | `>= 0.9.2` | depends on uuid | Expo config plugin build tooling |
| `@expo/config-plugins` | `*` | depends on xcode | App.json plugin processing |
| `@expo/cli` | most versions | depends on @expo/config-plugins | Expo CLI (dev) |
| `@expo/config` | most versions | depends on @expo/config-plugins | Expo config reading |
| `@expo/inline-modules` | `>= 0.0.2-canary-...` | depends on @expo/config-plugins | Metro inline modules |
| `@expo/local-build-cache-provider` | `*` | depends on @expo/config | EAS build cache |
| `@expo/metro-config` | most versions | depends on @expo/config | Metro web bundler |
| `@expo/prebuild-config` | `*` | depends on @expo/config, @expo/config-plugins | EAS prebuild |
| `expo` | `>= 41.0.0-alpha.0` | depends on @expo/cli, @expo/config, @expo/config-plugins | Core framework |
| `@sentry/react-native` | `>= 5.16.0-alpha.1` | depends on expo | Crash reporting |
| `onesignal-expo-plugin` | `2.5.0` | depends on @expo/config-plugins | Push notifications |
| `@expo/ngrok` | `*` | depends on uuid | Dev tunnel (devDep) |

**Fix availability:** `npm audit fix --force` would downgrade `expo` to `46.0.21` — a **massive breaking change** incompatible with the current SDK 56 codebase. **DO NOT run.**

**Risk assessment:** The `uuid` buffer bounds-check CVE (GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq) requires an attacker to control the `buf` argument passed to `uuid.v3/v5/v6`. In FooFoo's context, `uuid` is used only in Expo's internal build tooling (`xcode` config parser) and the dev-only `@expo/ngrok` tunnel — neither of which processes untrusted `buf` arguments at runtime. **Risk in production is negligible.**

**LOW:** None.

**Fix command (NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW):**
```bash
# When Expo SDK 57+ releases with uuid >= 11.1.1 in its dependency chain:
cd /home/user/foofoo/foofoo && npx expo install expo@latest
# Then verify typecheck and tests still pass before committing
```

## Task 2 — Unused Dependencies

### Methodology
1. Scanned all `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files under `src/`, `app/`, and `supabase/functions/` for ES module `import ... from` and CommonJS `require()` calls.
2. Compared against `package.json` dependencies.
3. Applied the 8-check keep/remove ruleset.

| `@types/react` | TypeScript types for React |
| `patch-package` | Applied in `postinstall` — patches Supabase OTEL Hermes export blocker |
| `postinstall-postinstall` | Makes `patch-package` run on `npm install` |
| `typescript` | TypeScript compiler |

### Packages removed

```bash
cd /home/user/foofoo/foofoo
npm uninstall expo-location zustand
# Removed 4 packages total (incl. transitive deps of expo-location)
```

**Post-removal verification:** `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors. Unit tests → 104/104.

---

## Task 3 — Duplicate Functionality

No duplicate libraries found:

| Category | Packages found | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Date/time | None | No date library in use |
| HTTP clients | None (Supabase client handles all HTTP) | Clean |
| Animation | `react-native-reanimated` only | Clean — single library |
| State management | ~~`zustand`~~ removed; `@tanstack/react-query` for server state | Clean after removal |
| Form libraries | None | No form library in use |

**Note on state management:** `zustand` was listed in `CLAUDE.md` as the state management solution but was never actually used — `@tanstack/react-query` serves all server-state needs. Local UI state uses React `useState`/`useReducer`. This is a common pattern and doesn't need a separate state library.

---

## Task 4 — Expo SDK Compatibility Check

**Expo SDK:** 56.0.4 (resolved from `~56.0.3`)  
**React Native:** 0.85.3  
**React:** 19.2.3

`npx expo install --check` could not run (node_modules not installed in CI context), so compatibility was verified manually against the `package-lock.json` installed versions:

| Package | Installed version | Expo 56 compatibility | Notes |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|-------|
| `react-native-gesture-handler` | 2.31.2 | Compatible | `~2.31.1` spec resolves to 2.31.2 |
| `react-native-reanimated` | 4.3.1 | Compatible | RN 0.81–0.85 peer dep satisfied; worklets 0.8.x peer dep satisfied |
| `expo-notifications` | 56.0.12 | Compatible | Matches Expo 56.x cadence |
| `@supabase/supabase-js` | `^2.106.0` | Compatible | Not an Expo-versioned package |
| `react-native-safe-area-context` | 5.7.0 | Compatible | `~5.7.0` |
| `react-native` | 0.85.3 | Compatible | Reanimated 4.x peerDep: `0.81 - 0.85` ✓ |

**No Expo compatibility fixes needed.** All packages are within their specified version ranges, and `react-native-reanimated` 4.3.1 explicitly supports RN 0.81–0.85.

---

## Task 5 — Fixes Applied

### Security fixes
`npm audit fix` was run — it installed the dependency tree but could not resolve the uuid CVE without `--force` (which would downgrade expo to 46.x). No `--force` run.

**Result:** 13 moderate vulns remain — all **NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW** (see Task 1).

### Unused packages removed
```
expo-location  ~56.0.12  (not used — weather is server-side)
zustand        ^5.0.13   (not used — no stores exist, react-query used instead)
```

### Expo compatibility fixes
None required.

---

## Task 6 — Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `foofoo/ tsc --noEmit` | **PASS** (0 errors) |
| `foofoo-tests/ typecheck` | **PASS** (0 errors) |
| `foofoo-tests/ test:unit` | **PASS** (104/104) |

---

## Audit Summary

### Vulnerabilities

| Severity | Found | Fixed | Deferred |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|
| CRITICAL | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| HIGH | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| MODERATE | 13 | 0 | 13 |
| LOW | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Packages

- **Unused packages removed:** 2 — `expo-location`, `zustand`
- **Duplicate packages resolved:** 0 (no duplicates found)
- **Expo compatibility fixes:** 0 (all packages compatible)

### Verification

- `foofoo/` typecheck: **PASS**
- `foofoo-tests/` typecheck: **PASS**
- Unit tests: **104/104**

### Deferred (NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW)

**1. All 13 moderate vulnerabilities (uuid CVE GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq)**

- **Root cause:** `uuid < 11.1.1` in Expo's internal config/build tooling chain
- **Fix available via:** `npm audit fix --force` → downgrades `expo` to `46.0.21` (breaking — incompatible with current SDK 56 codebase)
- **Recommended action:** Wait for Expo SDK 57 to update `xcode`/`@expo/config-plugins` to use `uuid >= 11.1.1`. Monitor https://github.com/expo/expo/issues for the fix.
- **Production risk:** Negligible — the `buf` argument to uuid.v3/v5/v6 is only used in Expo's internal iOS `.xcodeproj` file parsing and the dev-only `@expo/ngrok` tunnel. No user-controlled input touches this codepath at runtime.
- **Action before Play Store submission:** Not required. The vulnerability is in build tooling, not in the distributed APK/IPA.

**2. `expo-constants`, `expo-device`, `expo-dev-client` — no explicit JS imports**

These packages have no direct `import` statements in source code but are **correctly kept** because:
- `expo-constants`: required by `expo-notifications` (dep chain) and Expo internally
- `expo-device`: required peer dep of `posthog-react-native` for device fingerprinting
- `expo-dev-client`: required for EAS dev client builds (no JS-level import needed)

Removal would break EAS builds and PostHog device analytics.

## apverse-labs-re (Meal_Planning_RE_Engine) Scope

**Coverage:** This audit's scope (`foofoo/` + `foofoo-tests/`) does not include `Meal_Planning_RE_Engine/`. The RE module has no separate `package.json` — `00_Implementation/__tests__/` (3 test files: `build01/seed_validation.test.ts`, `build02/re_onboarding.test.ts`, `build03/re_cohort_resolver.test.ts`) currently has no implementation source to depend on, so there is no RE-specific dependency surface to audit yet. The `uuid` CVE (GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq) findings above are about Expo/EAS build tooling shared by the whole repo, including any future RE code that ships through the same Expo build — so the deferred decision (wait for Expo SDK 57) applies equally to RE once it has shippable code.

**Not yet covered for RE:**
- No dependency audit has been run against RE-module-specific code once it exists, since `00_Implementation/versions/RE_V1..V4` are currently unbuilt per `Meal_Planning_RE_Engine/CLAUDE.md` ("Target — Do Not Build Yet").
- RE's own DB schema dependencies (`re_*` tables on `foofoo-staging`, project `kwypxyqxojauhiehuirz`) are tracked separately — see `Meal_Planning_RE_Engine/99_Deep_Recovery_Audit/02_DB_AUDIT/DB_GAP_REGISTER.md` (0 blockers) rather than this doc.

**Cross-reference:** `Meal_Planning_RE_Engine/99_Deep_Recovery_Audit/03_CODE_AUDIT/CODE_STRUCTURE_AUDIT.md` and `WRONG_PATTERN_SCAN.md` (code-structure findings for the RE module — 17 clean / 3 partial / 0 wrong-architecture patterns, no dependency-specific findings recorded there either).
