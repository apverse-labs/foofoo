## What Is FooFoo?

AI-powered meal decision assistant for the Indian market. Every morning, users see a personalised Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner meal plan. Swipe to browse, lock what they like, cook or order online.

**Core product = the DECISION ("what to eat"), not the instruction ("how to cook").**

The **Recommendation Engine (RE)** is the heart of the product. It must always work correctly before anything else matters.

App name is configured in `src/config/constants.ts` → `APP_NAME = "Foofoo"`. Change it there, updates everywhere.

---

## Platform

Single codebase for **Android + iOS + Web** using React Native Web + Expo.
- Android: primary test device via Expo Go
- iOS: via Expo Go on iPhone
- Web: runs in browser via `npx expo start --web`

No local Xcode or Android Studio needed. Builds happen in Expo EAS cloud.

## Database

**42 MVP-active tables.** Full spec in Doc 11A (Final Merged Database Schema v4).

Key groups:
- **Food Knowledge Base:** `dishes`, `cuisines_master`, `dish_tags`, `ingredients_master`, `meal_ingredients`, `dish_combos`, `dish_combo_items`, `term_synonyms`
- **User & Preferences:** `profiles`, `user_diet_rules`, `user_category_preferences`, `user_inferred_prefs`, `user_behavioral_profile`, `never_list`, `user_recipe_affinity`
- **Planner & RE:** `planner`, `planner_carousel`, `suggestion_logs`, `recommendation_debug_log`, `weather_cache`, `region_food_affinity`
- **App Intelligence:** `app_events`, `experiments`, `experiment_assignments`
- **Operations:** `audit_log`, `etl_jobs`, `notification_log`, `referrals`, `media_assets`

**Critical rules:**
- All PKs are UUIDs (except `dishes.id` which is integer + sequence)
- All timestamps stored as UTC `timestamptz`. IST conversion happens in Edge Functions and client only.
- Diet exclusions use `excluded_ingredients integer[]` (NOT text — avoids language-matching bugs)
- Food DNA stored in `dish_tags` junction (not columns) — supports unlimited dimensions
- Auto-derivation: `allergens`, `diet_type`, `is_jain` computed from ingredient flags via `derive-dish-attributes` script — never manual
- RLS on every table: `WHERE user_id = auth.uid()`
- Cascade delete on user deletion. Anonymise `suggestion_logs` (keep for analytics). Retain `audit_log` (3-year DPDP requirement).
- Supabase region: **ap-south-1 (Mumbai)** — required for latency

**Connection:** Use `supabase` client from `src/services/supabase.ts` — never import createClient directly in screens.

## Recommendation Engine (RE)

**The heart of FooFoo. Prioritise correctness here above everything else.**

### RE Versions
| Version | When | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| RE v1 | MVP launch (Sprint 3) | Build now |
| RE v2 | Week 3+ post-launch | Build Sprint 6 |
| RE v2.5 | Weeks 4–8 post-launch | Tier 2 tags active |
| RE v3 | Phase 1.5 (5K+ MAU) | K-means clustering |
| RE v4 | Phase 2–3 | Full collaborative filtering |

### RE v1 Scoring Pipeline (build first)
1. **Hard filter** — exclude by `diet_type`, `allergens` (integer IDs), `never_list`, `is_active=false`
2. **Cuisine boost** — user's Frequently bucket: +0.3, Occasionally: +0.1, Never: excluded
3. **Meal item boost** — user's bucket preferences for specific dishes: +0.2 to +0.4
4. **Weather boost** — cold/rainy: heavy/spicy +0.15; hot: light/chilled +0.15
5. **Home state boost** — regional affinity score from `region_food_affinity` table: +0.0 to +0.2
6. **Day-of-week** — `user_dish_patterns.preferred_days` (post MVP Week 3)
7. **Variety guard** — penalise dishes seen in last 3 days: -0.5
8. **Random factor** — 5% randomness (prevents staleness)
9. **Rank** — return top 8 per slot
10. **Combo-aware** — score combos as unit; swap components if one is never-listed
11. **Coherence** — don't suggest 3 heavy dishes in one day (learned per user, not hard rule)

### RE Fallback (if pipeline not ready by Day 3 of Sprint 3 Week 6)
Simplified: hard filters only + cuisine boost + random. Ship this, iterate to full pipeline.

### Food DNA Tiers
- **Tier 1 (MVP):** cuisine, diet_type, allergens, spice_level, cook_time_mins, difficulty, calories
- **Tier 2 (Weeks 4–8 post-launch):** cooking_method, primary_taste, texture, heaviness, richness, sweetness, weather_affinity
- **Tier 3 (Phase 2+):** mouthfeel, aroma_profile, fermentation, serving_temp, health_tags, ingredient_complexity

---

## Content Model

| Level | Content | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | Dish cards: name, photo, Tier 1 Food DNA tags, cuisine, diet, cook time, difficulty, calories | All 500 dishes at MVP launch |
| 2 | Simple ingredients: names only, no quantities. E.g. "paneer, tomato, cream, onion, spices" | All 500 dishes at MVP launch |
| 3 | Full recipes: step-by-step, quantities, audio/video | Phase 0.5 — top 50–100 dishes first |

---

## Gestures (Non-negotiable — must feel exact)

| Gesture | Action | Component |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Swipe Left / Right | Browse carousel options | Meal card |
| Long Press Down (300ms) | Never — remove dish permanently | Meal card |
| Long Press Up (300ms) | Not Today — skip today only | Meal card |
| Tap Lock icon | Lock meal (no RE re-suggestion) | Meal card |
| Tap Plus icon | Add dish to future date | Meal Detail |
| Tap card | Open Meal Detail | Meal card |
| Pull Down | Refresh plan | Home Day View |

All gestures log to `suggestion_logs` and `app_events`. This is how RE v2 learns.

---

## Design System (from Doc 09)

```typescript
// Already in src/config/constants.ts
COLORS = {
  primary: '#2D6A4F',       // Deep green
  accent: '#FF6B35',        // Warm orange
  background: '#FAFAF8',
  surface: '#FFFFFF',
  textPrimary: '#1A1A1A',
  textSecondary: '#6B6B6B',
}
SPACING = { xs:4, sm:8, md:16, lg:24, xl:32, xxl:48 }
BORDER_RADIUS = { sm:8, md:16, lg:24, full:9999 }
TIMING = { LONG_PRESS_MS: 300, ANIMATION_NORMAL: 350 }
```

- Font: Inter (with system fallback)
- Min touch target: 48dp on all interactive elements
- Dish photo always dominates the card — UI elements support, never compete
- Blurhash placeholder while images load — never blank white boxes
- All animations: 60fps, fluid, never abrupt

---

## Coding Rules (follow strictly)

1. **TypeScript strict** — no `any` types. Add types to `src/types/index.ts`.
2. **Max 300 lines per file** — split into sub-files if longer.
3. **No raw SQL in screens** — all Supabase queries go through `src/repositories/`.
4. **No API calls in screens** — all external calls go through `src/services/`.
5. **Every async function gets try/catch** — errors logged to Sentry.
6. **Structured logs** — format: `[MODULE_NAME] message`. E.g. `[RE-SCORING] Plan generated in 1.2s`.
7. **All timestamps UTC in DB** — convert to IST only in Edge Functions and UI display.
8. **Error response format from Edge Functions:**
   ```json
   // Success: { "success": true, "data": { ... } }
   // Error:   { "success": false, "error": { "code": "PLAN_GENERATION_FAILED", "message": "...", "retry": true } }
   ```

## Function Documentation Standard

Every function must have this JSDoc block:

```typescript
/**
 * @summary One-line: WHAT the function does (not how).
 *
 * @description Optional expanded context, edge cases, intent.
 *
 * @param {string} userId - Supabase UUID of the requesting user
 * @returns {Promise<DailyPlan>} Generated meal plan for the date
 *
 * @throws {SupabaseError} When database query fails
 *
 * @calledBy
 * - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — Home screen on mount
 * - `supabase/functions/daily-batch/index.ts` — 5 AM batch
 */
```

---

## Environment Variables

All in `.env.local` (gitignored). Prefixed `EXPO_PUBLIC_` so Expo can read them.
Secrets in Edge Functions go in **Supabase Vault** (Dashboard → Settings → Vault) — never hardcoded.

| Variable | Where to Get It | When Needed |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | supabase.com → project → Settings → API | NOW |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | supabase.com → project → Settings → API | NOW |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY` | openweathermap.org → My Account → API Keys | Sprint 3 |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID` | onesignal.com → your app | Sprint 5–6 |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` | posthog.com → project settings | Sprint 6 |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | sentry.io → project settings → DSN | Sprint 6 |

## Product Decision Log (overrides planning docs where conflicts exist) | Onboarding UX Fixes
- [#014] Bucket Selector: Next button is ALWAYS enabled. Unselected items 
  default to 'O' (Occasional) when user taps Next. Do NOT force all items 
  to be selected before allowing Next.
- [#014] Bucket Selector: Tapping a chip cycles: Unselected(gray) → 
  Frequently(green) → Occasionally(orange) → Never(red) → Unselected(gray).
  First tap on an unselected chip must go to Frequently. This is correct.
  But user must ALSO be able to long-press a chip to get a bottom sheet 
  with direct selection: "Frequently / Occasionally / Never / Leave unselected"
- [#014] Food preference cards (Veg/Non-Veg etc.) — Phase 1 will filter 
  bucket content based on this selection. For MVP, show all dishes regardless 
  of food preference in buckets but this is noted for Phase 1 improvement.
- [#014] Server state: intro screens must show on every cold start during 
  development. State persistence to be implemented in a dedicated session.
*Update this file at end of every sprint. Claude Code reads it fresh every session.*
